Project Name:
Comprehensive Derivatives Pricing and Risk Management Platform

Objective:
Build a robust platform to price complex financial derivatives, manage portfolio risks, and optimize trading strategies across multiple asset classes in real time.

Key Components and Use Cases for Each Technique:
1. Monte Carlo Simulations
Use Case:

Exotic Options Pricing: Simulate paths for underlying assets to calculate the price of exotic derivatives (e.g., barrier options, Asian options, or quanto options) where closed-form solutions donâ€™t exist.
Risk Metrics: Simulate portfolio returns to compute Value at Risk (VaR) and Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR).
Example in the Project:

Pricing a multi-asset basket option by simulating correlated asset price paths using Cholesky decomposition.
2. Finite Difference Methods (FDM)
Use Case:

American Options Pricing: Solve the Black-Scholes PDE with boundary conditions for early exercise features of American options.
Real-Time Greeks Calculation: Use FDM to calculate sensitivity measures like Delta, Gamma, and Vega for hedging purposes.
Example in the Project:

Implement a Crank-Nicholson scheme to solve PDEs for multi-dimensional options, such as swaptions or Bermudan options.
3. Stochastic Processes
Use Case:

Interest Rate Modeling: Use stochastic processes (e.g., Vasicek, Hull-White models) to simulate future interest rate paths for fixed-income derivatives.
Credit Risk Analysis: Employ processes like Poisson jumps for modeling default events in credit derivatives.
Example in the Project:

Model an interest rate swap portfolio using stochastic processes to simulate forward curves and predict future cash flows.
4. PDE Solvers
Use Case:

High-Dimensional Derivatives Pricing: Use PDE solvers to compute prices of options with complex payoff structures, such as rainbow options or convertible bonds.
Risk Metrics: Calculate expected shortfall by solving PDEs derived from portfolio dynamics.
Example in the Project:

Use an implicit method for solving the Heston model PDE for pricing options with stochastic volatility.
5. Black-Scholes Model
Use Case:

Vanilla Option Pricing: Use the Black-Scholes formula for fast and accurate pricing of standard European options.
Benchmarking: Validate advanced numerical models by comparing with analytical Black-Scholes solutions.
Example in the Project:

Integrate Black-Scholes for real-time pricing and hedging of vanilla options to compare with Monte Carlo results for exotics.
6. Genetic Algorithms (GAs)
Use Case:

Trading Strategy Optimization: Use GAs to optimize parameters for statistical arbitrage or machine learning models.
Portfolio Optimization: Evolve portfolios to maximize Sharpe Ratio while considering transaction costs and constraints.
Example in the Project:

Optimize hedging strategies for a large derivative portfolio by finding the best set of trades that minimize risk exposure.
7. Statistical Arbitrage
Use Case:

Mean-Reversion Trading: Identify mispriced assets or anomalies in correlated securities and execute market-neutral strategies.
Factor-Based Strategies: Use statistical techniques to model and profit from market inefficiencies.
Example in the Project:

Develop a pairs trading module for equities, using historical price spreads to identify profitable trade opportunities.
Project Workflow and Integration
