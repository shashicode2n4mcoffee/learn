Project: Forex Options Pricing and Risk Management System

This project models a real-world system used by large banks to price forex options and manage associated risks. Such systems typically involve the implementation of advanced mathematical models, integration with market data feeds, and risk metrics calculation. Here's a high-level overview:


---

Objective

Develop a system to:

1. Price Forex Options using industry-standard models like the Black-Scholes model or its variations for forex.


2. Compute Greeks (Delta, Gamma, Vega, Theta, and Rho) to assess sensitivities.


3. Simulate Portfolio Risk using Monte Carlo simulations.


4. Integrate with Market Data Feeds to fetch real-time forex rates and volatility data.

System Architecture

1. Modules:

Market Data Integration: Fetch real-time forex rates, volatility, and interest rates.

Option Pricing Engine: Implement the Black-Scholes model for forex options.

Risk Metrics Calculator: Compute Greeks and Value at Risk (VaR).

User Interface (Optional): Simple UI to input trade details and view outputs.

Database: Store option trades and market data for backtesting.



2. Technology Stack:

Language: C++ for performance.

Libraries: Boost, QuantLib, and Eigen.

Data Integration: Use APIs like Bloomberg, Reuters, or simulated data.

Storage: SQLite or PostgreSQL.

Features and Implementation

1. Option Pricing Engine

Implement the Garman-Kohlhagen Model (an extension of Black-Scholes for forex):


C = S_0 \cdot e^{(r_f - r_d)T} \cdot N(d_1) - K \cdot e^{-r_dT} \cdot N(d_2)






2. Greeks Calculation

Compute sensitivities:

Delta: Change in option price with respect to spot price.

Gamma: Change in Delta with respect to spot price.

Vega: Change in option price with respect to volatility.

Theta: Time decay of the option price.

Rho: Sensitivity to interest rate changes.



3. Risk Management

Monte Carlo Simulation:

Simulate potential portfolio value paths to estimate Value at Risk (VaR).

Perform stress testing for extreme scenarios.



4. Market Data Integration

Simulate or fetch real-time forex rates, interest rates, and volatility using an API.

Use CSV files for testing if APIs aren't accessible.


5. Trade Storage and Analysis

Store trades and market data in a database.

Enable backtesting to evaluate strategies.

Implementation Plan

Step 1: Set Up the Environment

Install QuantLib for pricing and risk modeling.

Use Boost for advanced C++ features and Eigen for linear algebra.


Step 2: Market Data Integration

Build a mock API to simulate market data feeds for forex pairs and volatilities.

Parse data using Boost libraries.


Step 3: Build the Pricing Engine

Implement the Garman-Kohlhagen model.

Validate with known forex option pricing examples.


Step 4: Implement Greeks Calculations

Extend the pricing engine to compute Delta, Gamma, Vega, Theta, and Rho.


Step 5: Risk Management

Implement Monte Carlo simulations to compute VaR.

Allow users to stress test portfolios.


Step 6: Build a Database Layer

Use SQLite or PostgreSQL to store trade data, market data, and risk metrics.


Step 7: User Interface (Optional)

Build a simple CLI or GUI to input trade details and view results.

Deliverables

1. Executable Pricing System: Capable of real-time option pricing and risk analysis.


2. Market Data Integration: Fetch or simulate forex rates, volatilities, and interest rates.


3. Greeks and VaR Reports: Provide a summary of sensitivities and risks.


4. Backtesting Capability: Evaluate historical performance.
